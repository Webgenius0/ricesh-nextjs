          We believe in home, that it should restore us from today and ready us
          for tomorrow. We believe in friendship, because friends who feel like
          family are the best kind of friends, and that nothing matters more
          than family. We believe in seeking the balance between hustle and rest
          and learning to find contentment in both. We believe everyone deserves
          a seat at the table and everyone has a story worth telling. We believe
          in human kindness, knowing we are made better when we all work
          together. We believe in courage, in cartwheeling past our comfort
          zones and trying something a little bit scary every day.

          We believe that failure needn't be a negative thing; rather, we learn
          from our mistakes and fail smarter next time. We believe in doing good
          work that matters and in choosing that, nudging others toward doing
          the same. We believe that newer isn't always better and that it's time
          for the pendulum of trend to swing back to the basics. We believe in
          unearthing beauty, however hidden or subtle it might be. We believe
          that each day is a gift and that everyday miracles are scattered about
          if only we have eyes to see. And of all heroic pursuits large or
          small, we believe there may be none greater than a life well loved.
